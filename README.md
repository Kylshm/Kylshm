# About me
Hello ðŸ‘‹

I go by *Kylshm* on Github :)

I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering student who enjoys software development, fun coding projects and learning new stuff - later in the year I plan to teach myself C or C++ programming because _why not_ ;)

I have working knowledge in Python and Java, basics of HTML, and I'm looking to collaborate on some open source code projects and making my own projects. 

Outside of programming I sketch, read and have personal worldbuilding and conlanging projects.

You can contact me using my email address in my profile :)
