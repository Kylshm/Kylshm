Hello ðŸ‘‹


I'm an Electrical and Computer Engineering student who enjoys software development, fun coding projects and learning new stuff - later in the year I plan to teach myself C or C++ programming because _why not_ ;)

I have working knowledge in Python and Java, basics of HTML, and I'm looking to collaborate on some open source code projects and make my own projects. 

Outside of programming I sketch, read and work on some worldbuilding and conlanging projects.

You can contact me using my email address in my profile :)
